# 🍎 Apple Inventory System  
### Enterprise Inventory & Order Management System – Oracle APEX

---

## 📌 About The Application

Apple Inventory System is a full-stack web application built using **Oracle APEX** to manage products, inventory, customers, and sales orders in a structured enterprise-style environment.

The system simulates a real-world inventory and order management solution where administrators can:

- Manage product catalog and categories
- Track stock levels in real time
- Create multi-step sales orders
- Monitor order statuses
- Analyze sales and inventory performance
- Manage admin users and internal notes
- Integrate external exchange rate APIs

This project demonstrates strong knowledge in:

- Relational Database Design
- Oracle SQL & PL/SQL
- Oracle APEX Page Development
- Business Logic Implementation
- REST API Integration
- Reporting & Data Visualization

## 🗄️ Database Design

The system is built using a fully normalized relational schema with proper constraints and relationships.

### Main Tables

####  Categories
- `category_id` (Primary Key)
- `category_name` (Unique)
- `description`

####  Products
- `product_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `description`
- `category_id` (Foreign Key → Categories)
- `unit_price`
- `stock_quantity`
- `image_url`

####  Customers
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `address`

####  Orders
- `order_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key → Customers)
- `order_date`
- `status`
- `total_amount`

####  Order_Items
- `order_item_id` (Primary Key)
- `order_id` (Foreign Key → Orders)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key → Products)
- `quantity`
- `unit_price`

####  Admin_Users
- Stores system administrators

####  Admin_Notes
- Stores internal system notes

## 🔗 Relationships

- One Category → Many Products  
- One Customer → Many Orders  
- One Order → Many Order Items  
- One Product → Many Order Items  

All relationships are enforced using **Foreign Key Constraints**.

No database triggers are used.  
All business logic is implemented inside Oracle APEX processes.
