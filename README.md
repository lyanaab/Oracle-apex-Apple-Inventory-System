#  Apple Inventory System  
### Enterprise Inventory & Order Management System  
Built with Oracle APEX & Oracle Database

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Apple Inventory System is a full-featured enterprise-style web application developed using **Oracle APEX** and **Oracle Database**.

The system simulates a real-world inventory and sales management platform where administrators can manage products, customers, and multi-step sales orders within a structured relational database environment.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:

- Relational Database Design
- SQL & PL/SQL Programming
- Oracle APEX Page Development
- Business Logic Handling (APEX Processes)
- Interactive Reports & Data Visualization
- REST API Integration
- Wizard-Based Workflow Implementation

3. Review & Confirm  
4. Finish & Update Order Status  

Additional order features:
- Order details page
- Change order status
- Status filtering
- Date range filtering

###  Analytics & Reporting

- Order analysis
- Category-based insights
- Dynamic filtering reports

###  Exchange Rate Integration
- REST API consumption
- External currency rate retrieval

###  Security & Administration
- Login page
- Admin users management
- Internal admin notes system

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

The system is built using a fully normalized relational schema with strict constraints and enforced relationships.

### Main Tables

- **Categories**
- **Products**
- **Customers**
- **Orders**
- **Order_Items**
- **Admin_Users**
- **Admin_Notes**

### Key Relationships

- One Category → Many Products  
- One Customer → Many Orders  
- One Order → Many Order Items  
- One Product → Many Order Items  

All relationships are enforced using **Foreign Key Constraints**.

✔ Identity columns  
✔ Check constraints  
✔ Unique constraints  
✔ No database triggers (Business logic handled inside APEX)
